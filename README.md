# Project: UNSWipe

![UNSWipe logo](./public/UNSWipe.png)

## 🪴 1. Inspiration

DevSoc projects like Circles, Notangles and Unielectives take care of the hassle that comes with being a university student looking for courses to study ☝️🤓. But what if they want someone to work/study/hangout with in that course?

It is often difficult to find course partners/groups when everyone else you know has already completed the course before you. One can DM others for so long before they eventually submit themselves to the fact that they will have to settle for a stranger they know nothing about.😔

UNSWipe takes the hassle out of finding a suitable project partner/group by directing users through a UX flow similar to [Tinder](https://tinder.com/en-AU). Transparency is key when finding someone you'll actually enjoy working with. Like someone you see on the screen based on academic/social categories? Swipe right to match! 📲
